            Nobita's life was fraught with difficulties and setbacks, and he rarely felt content. He had trouble at school, getting low grades and failing to stay motivated. His academic pursuits became a source of stress and anxiety, making him feel inadequate. Nobita had trouble in school, but he also had to deal with constant bullying from Gian and Suneo. Their jokes and teasing made him feel worthless and alone. His inability to blend in and build connections with others was hampered by his low self-esteem and social shyness. Nobita's isolation was exacerbated by his repeated failures and mistakes, which left him feeling like he had nowhere to turn. Combined with the stress from his family, these events left Nobita feeling hopeless and wishing for a fresh start. Doraemon, a futuristic robotic cat, entered Nobita's life during this low period, bringing with him the promise of a better tomorrow.
        <br>Sewashi saw this all so to make Nobita's life bearable, he gifted him Doraemon....</p></div>
