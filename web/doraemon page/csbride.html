    <h2 class="ff"> If Non-chan and Nobita got married</h2>  
    <p>
        Nobita and Non-chan used to play together until the day Gian and Suneo teased Nobita about her. This made him angry at Non-chan and he took one of her shoes, leaving her very sad. Nobita wanted to apologize to Non-chan but she and her family had already moved to America. Later, Nobita went back in time using the Time Machine to the point before she moved away and he used the Time Furoshiki to make himself younger and then apologized to Non-chan at that time. This made Non-chan happy and she gave Nobita her other shoe.
        <br>
        In a hypothetical scenario where Non-chan and Nobita from the Doraemon series were married to each other, their shared familiarity and history growing up together would create a strong foundation for their relationship. Their friendship and compatibility would play a crucial role in their marriage, as they may have developed a deep understanding of each other's personalities, interests, and quirks.
    </p>
    <img src="../../images/nonchan2.jpg" id="two">
    <p>
        Non-chan's supportive and caring nature, combined with Nobita's kind-heartedness, would contribute to a nurturing and encouraging environment within their marriage. They would be each other's pillars of support, providing emotional strength and understanding in both joyous and challenging times. As they embark on their journey together, Non-chan and Nobita would inspire and motivate each other to pursue their dreams, overcome their weaknesses, and grow as individuals. Furthermore, Non-chan's connection to Suneo and his social circle would likely strengthen the bond between Nobita and Suneo as brothers-in-law, potentially leading to a more harmonious extended family network. It's important to reiterate that this scenario is purely speculative and not a part of the official Doraemon canon, but exploring such hypothetical situations allows us to consider the dynamics and possibilities within the characters' relationships.
