        <br><br><br>Sewashi's overall appearance is very similar to Nobisuke, Nobita's son, having fair skin, black hair and big black eyes. In Stand by Me Doraemon, however, his hair is ginger in colour.

        In the 1973 anime, he wore a red and white jumpsuit. He also wore glasses like Nobita, but they were removed in the subsequent anime series. In the 1979 anime, he wore a teal and white shirt, long white pants with a red belt as well as teal boots. He wears a jumpsuit with a turtleneck shirt underneath in the 2005 anime and Stand by Me Doraemon, although the color schemes are different.

<h2>Personality:</h2><p>
    Sewashi, like his ancestors, does not perform well in school, but is otherwise quite athletic. He is also helpful on occasions, having sent Doraemon and Dorami to help his ancestor, Nobita. Like Nobita, he is afraid of dentists.
</p><br><br>
<br>
<h2>Background:</h2>
<p>Not much is known about Sewashi's family than his great-great-grandparents, Nobita and Shizuka.

    Sewashi's mother is only shown once, and resembles Nobita's mother, but more futuristic, a bit nicer and wears no glasses. Sewashi's father, who is Nobita and Shizuka's great-grandson, has appeared in the series a few times (in the short movie, 2112: The Birth of Doraemon).
    
    It is known that Nobisuke (Shizuka and Nobita's son) is his great-grandfather and that Nobita's parents are his great-great-great-grandparents.
